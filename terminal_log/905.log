[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete[m
       the given refs.[m
[m
       You can make interesting things happen to a repository every time you push into[m
       it, by setting up [4mhooks[24m there. See documentation for [1mgit-receive-pack[0m(1).[m
[m
       When the command line does not specify where to push with the [1m<repository>[0m[m
       argument, [1mbranch.*.remote[0m configuration for the current branch is consulted to[m
       determine where to push. If the configuration is missing, it defaults to [4morigin[24m.[m
[m
       When the command line does not specify what to push with [1m<refspec>...[0m arguments[m
       or [1m--all[0m, [1m--mirror[0m, [1m--tags[0m options, the command finds the default [1m<refspec>[0m by[m
       consulting [1mremote.*.push[0m configuration, and if it is not found, honors[m
       [1mpush.default[0m configuration to decide what to push (See [1mgit-config[0m(1) for the[m
       meaning of [1mpush.default[0m).[m
[m
       When neither the command-line nor the configuration specify what to push, the[m
       default behavior is used, which corresponds to the [1msimple[0m value for [1mpush.default[0m:[m
       the current branch is pushed to the corresponding upstream branch, but as a[m
       safety measure, the push is aborted if the upstream branch does not have the same[m
       name as the local one.[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete[m
       the given refs.[m
[m
       You can make interesting things happen to a repository every time you push into[m
       it, by setting up [4mhooks[24m there. See documentation for [1mgit-receive-pack[0m(1).[m
[m
       When the command line does not specify where to push with the [1m<repository>[0m[m
       argument, [1mbranch.*.remote[0m configuration for the current branch is consulted to[m
       determine where to push. If the configuration is missing, it defaults to [4morigin[24m.[m
[m
       When the command line does not specify what to push with [1m<refspec>...[0m arguments[m
       or [1m--all[0m, [1m--mirror[0m, [1m--tags[0m options, the command finds the default [1m<refspec>[0m by[m
       consulting [1mremote.*.push[0m configuration, and if it is not found, honors[m
       [1mpush.default[0m configuration to decide what to push (See [1mgit-config[0m(1) for the[m
       meaning of [1mpush.default[0m).[m
[m
       When neither the command-line nor the configuration specify what to push, the[m
       default behavior is used, which corresponds to the [1msimple[0m value for [1mpush.default[0m:[m
       the current branch is pushed to the corresponding upstream branch, but as a[m
       safety measure, the push is aborted if the upstream branch does not have the same[m
       name as the local one.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       <repository>[m
           The "remote" repository that is destination of a push operation. This[m
           parameter can be either a URL (see the section GIT URLS below) or the name of[m

           not explicitly intended to be shared but can be used to optimize the transfer[m
           if the peer also has them. The attacker chooses an object ID X to steal and[m
           sends a ref to X, but isn’t required to send the content of X because the[m
           victim already has it. Now the victim believes that the attacker has X, and[m
           it sends the content of X back to the attacker later. (This attack is most[m
           straightforward for a client to perform on a server, by creating a ref to X[m
           in the namespace the client has access to and then fetching it. The most[m
           likely way for a server to perform it on a client is to "merge" X into a[m

           have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta against X. The delta[m
           reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the attacker.[m

           sends a ref to X, but isn’t required to send the content of X because the[m
           victim already has it. Now the victim believes that the attacker has X, and[m
           it sends the content of X back to the attacker later. (This attack is most[m
           straightforward for a client to perform on a server, by creating a ref to X[m
           in the namespace the client has access to and then fetching it. The most[m
           likely way for a server to perform it on a client is to "merge" X into a[m
           public branch and hope that the user does additional work on this branch and[m
           pushes it back to the server without noticing the merge.)[m
[m
        2. As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal. The victim sends an[m
           object Y that the attacker already has, and the attacker falsely claims to[m
           have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta against X. The delta[m
